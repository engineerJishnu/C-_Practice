# C++ -_Practice

I did some C++ coding practice in Xcode at MacBook Air during Eid Holidays.

This year June 2018, we got 5 days Eid holidays and family is already away for summer vacation to Calcutta. Also, I got new MacBook Air. The reason is that I wantedto be well verse with Mac platform and writing as well as running C++ programs in Xcode IDE. 

It was a good experience.

The areas covered are:
creating a C++ project in Xcode, creating a header.hpp as well as header.cpp file. The main.cpp was automatically created during making of the project.
