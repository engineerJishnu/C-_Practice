# C++ Programming Practice

Howdy friends!!!

I did some C++ coding practice in Xcode at MacBook Air during Eid Holidays.

This year June 2018, we got Eid holidays for 5 days and the family is already away for summer vacation to Calcutta. 

Also on 13/06/2018, I got new MacBook Air 13". 

The main goal is that I wanted to be well verse in working on Mac platform and finally writing as well as running C++ programs in Xcode IDE. 

It was a good experience.

The areas covered are:
creating a C++ project in Xcode as well github repository, creating a header.hpp as well as header.cpp file, functions, template, multithreading, anonymous functions, generic class, inheritance, pointers, smart pointers  etc. 

The main.cpp was automatically created during the process of the making new project.

All is done by self learning and also took help from google as well as saw some C++ videos in Youtube.

The example is extremely simple one....but its like a first step taken to understand the basic concept, syntax of programming using C++.

I welcome other newcomers as well as novice to go through it and if it does even smallest help to anyone....I feel its purpose is meaningfully served.

Finally, suggestion - if any are also most welcome.
